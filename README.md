One degree of latitude equals 111.1 Kilometers or approximately 60 Nautical Miles. Includes the direction of the latitude measurement, being either: N - North, or S - South.
-	**Longitude**: longitude decimal degree for a point. Positive values are used for both Eastern and Western hemisphere and have to be used in conjunction with the Longitude direction. The measure of the degree portion of longitude (000 to 180 degrees), indicating angular distance West or East of the prime meridian drawn from pole to pole around the Earth and passing through Greenwich, England. Includes the direction of the longitude measurement being either: E - East, or W - West.

The data on flow rate, city, state, and county was obtained by merging the CWNS with previously described procedure for determining if a facility has CHP. Description of utility service areas were used to determine the correct utility for each municipality.

## Billing Data
Each worksheet of `WWTP_Billing.xlsx` is given the name of the CWNS number corresponding to that facility. Each row of the tariff structure corresponds to a different tariff, so if a municipality with a flat electricity tariff would have only one row whereas a municipality with a complex tariff structure would have many rows. Gas tariffs are included only for facilities which have cogeneration, since without cogeneration natural gas costs are unaffected by energy flexibility for a typical wastewater treatment facility. The electricity and natural gas tariff data has the following columns:
-	**utility**: type of utility, i.e. “electric” or “gas”
-	**type**: type of charge. Options are “customer”, “demand”, and “energy”
-	**period**: name for the charge period. Only relevant for demand charges, since there can be multiple concurrent demand charges, i.e. a charge named “maximum” which is in effect 24 hours a day vs. a charge named “on-peak” which is only in effect during afternoon hours.
-	**basic_charge_limit (imperial)**: consumption limit above which the charge takes effect in imperial units (i.e., kWh of electricity and therms of natural gas). Default is 0. A limit is in effect until another limit supersedes it, e.g. if there are two charges, Charge 1 with basic_charge_limit = 0 and Charge 2 with basic_charge_limit = 1000, Charge 1 will be in effect until 1000 units are delivered, and Charge 2 will be in effect thereafter.
-	**basic_charge_limit (metric)**: consumption limit above which the charge takes effect in metric units (i.e., kWh of electricity and cubic meters of natural gas). Default is 0.  A limit is in effect until another limit supersedes it, e.g. if there are two charges, Charge 1 with basic_charge_limit = 0 and Charge 2 with basic_charge_limit = 1000, Charge 1 will be in effect until 1000 units are delivered, and Charge 2 will be in effect thereafter.
-	**month_start**: first month during which this charge occurs (1-12)
- **month_end**: last month during which this charge occurs (1-12)
-	**hour_start**: hour at which this charge starts (0-24)
-	**hour_end**: hour at which this charge ends (0-24)
-	**weekday_start**: first weekday on which this charge occurs (0 = Monday to 6 = Sunday)
-	**weekday_end**: last weekday on which this charge occurs (0 = Monday to 6 = Sunday)
-	**charge (imperial)**: cost represented as a float in imperial units. I.e., "$/month", "$/kWh", "$/kW", "$/therm", and "$/therm/hr" for customer charges, electric energy charges, electric demand charges, natural gas energy charges, and natural gas demand charges, respectively
-   **charge (metric)**: cost represented as a float in metric units. I.e., "$/month", "$/kWh", "$/kW", "$/m3", and "$/m3/hr" for customer charges, electric energy charges, electric demand charges, natural gas energy charges, and natural gas demand charges, respectively. A conversion factor of 2.83168 cubic meters to 1 therm was used.
-	**units**: units of the charge, e.g. “$/kWh”. If units are different between imperial and metric then imperial is listed followed by metric. E.g., "$/therm or $/m3".
-	**Notes**: any comments the authors felt would help explain unintuitive decisions in data collection or formatting

## Billing Assumptions
Besides the assumptions made for every facility laid out in the Methods section, many utilities had nuanced tariffs which required further simplifying assumptions. These assumptions are cataloged in `WWTP_Billing_Assumptions.xlsx`, which has two worksheets: `Electric` and `Gas`. Both have a new assumption on each row and identical columns:
-	**Assumptions**: explanation of the assumption the authors made in determining the correct tariff for these facilities
-	**CWNS_No_1, CWNS_No_2, …, CWNS_No_14**: list of facilities for which this assumption applies. “ALL” indicates the assumption was applied to all facilities.

## Reference List
There is a list of all the original tariffs used to compile this dataset, which includes the following information:
- **Document Title**: name of the document being referenced
- **Utility**: utility which published this tariff
- **Day Filed**: day on which this tariff was filed (if known)
- **Month Filed**: month in which this tariff was filed (if known)
- **Year Filed**: year in which this tariff was filed (if known)
- **Day Effective**: day on which this tariff became effective (if known)
- **Month Effective**: month in which this tariff became effective (if known)
- **Year Effective**: year in which this tariff became effective (if known)
- **Day Accessed**: day on which this tariff was downloaded (if known)
- **Month Accessed**: month in which this tariff was downloaded (if known)
- **Year Accessed**: year in which this tariff was downloaded (if known)
- **Relevant CWNS Numbers**: list of facilities to which this tariff applies

If the referenced tariff included multiple sheets with different filed or effective dates, then the most recent date of the entire book was used. Date accessed is only included for non-static HTML pages.

## Synthetic Energy Data
One week of sample energy data at a 15-minute timescale is copied for a year to be used by `sample_usage.py`.
`sample_usage.py` demonstrates some simple analysis that can be conducted using this dataset.
- **DateTime**: date and time of synthetic energy data sample
- **grid_to_plant_kW**: electricity delivered from the grid in kW
- **natural_gas_therm_per_hr**: natural gas delivered to the cogenerator in therms/hr

  abstract={Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are large electricity and natural gas consumers with untapped potential to recover carbon-neutral biogas and provide energy services for the grid. Techno-economic analysis of emerging energy recovery and management technologies is critical to understanding their commercial viability, but quantifying their energy cost savings potential is stymied by a lack of well curated, nationally representative electricity and natural gas tariff data. We present a dataset of electricity tariffs for the 100 largest WWTPs in the Clean Watershed Needs Survey (CWNS) and natural gas tariffs for the 54 of 100 WWTPs with on-site cogeneration. We manually collected tariffs from each utility's website and implemented data checks to ensure their validity. The dataset includes facility metadata, electricity tariffs, and natural gas tariffs (where cogeneration is present). Tariffs are current as of November 2021. We provide code for technical validation along with a sample simulation.},
